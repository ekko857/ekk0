\begin{abstract}
This document presents the results of a permutation analysis conducted to explore the correlation between years and temperature in Florida, aiming to address the question: "Is Florida getting warmer?"
\end{abstract}

\section*{Results}
The observed Pearson correlation coefficient between the years and temperature in Florida is \textbf{0.372}. To test the significance of this correlation, a permutation analysis with 10,000 iterations was conducted, reshuffling the temperature data to generate a distribution of random correlation coefficients.

The approximate p-value obtained from this analysis is \textbf{0}, suggesting that the correlation observed is SIGNIFICANT.

\section*{Interpretation}
The analysis suggests that there is a POSITIVE correlation between the years and temperature in Florida, implying that Florida is IS getting warmer over time.
